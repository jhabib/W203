  # Part 1: Multiple Choice
  Q1. b, Ordinary Least Squares regression

Q2. b, All coefficients for each independent variable equal zero

Q3. a, There are statistically significant relationships between each
independent variable and the dependent variable

Q4. b, Maximum number of pushups in 3 minutes (because it might be correlated
                                               with tricep strength which is already in our model)

Q5. d, because we did not ourselves subject people to this 
torment (um, treatment); we assume that the populations of the two CA counties 
do not differ substantially prior to the ISP ban on dating sites

Q6. c, Regression assumptions that have been met

Q7. b, The power of the test (is not a random variable, it's calculated)
                              
                              Q8. c, Insignificant results are commonly relegated to the file drawer
                              If this were actually true, only 5% or less of the publish research would 
                              not be reproducible. So relegating insignificant research to the file drawer 
                              does not help to explain why more than 5% of the published results appear to 
                              be type-1 errors
                              
                              # Part 2. Test Selection
                              Q9. a, chi-square (use_reddit ~ marital_status)
                              
                              Q10. d, ANOVA (life_quality ~ region)
                              
                              Q11. d, ANOVA (years_in_relationship ~ flirted_online)
                              
                              Q12.
