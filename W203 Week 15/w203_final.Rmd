# Part 1: Multiple Choice
Q1. d, ANOVA (to test the significance of OLS).

Q2. b, All coefficients for each independent variable equal zero (this is the null hypothesis of ANOVA for OLS).

Q3. e, None of the above.

Notes on Q3: 
--- c (b1 is not equal to zero) is NOT correct. ANOVA doesn't tell us which specific b is not equal to zero. It only tells us that one of the coefficients is not equal to zero, not which specific one.
--- d (the relationship in the underlying population is linear) is NOT correct. This is an assumption of the linear regression, not a result from significant ANOVA of linear regression. A significant ANOVA for OLS only tells us that at least one of the independent variable is linearly related to the dependent variable but not which specific independent variable.


Q4. b, Maximum number of pushups in 3 minutes. 
(because it might be correlated with tricep strength which is already in our model)

Q5. d,
because we did not ourselves subject people to this torment (um, treatment), it happened naturally. Further, if there were online daters in the country before ISP blocked access, we can now see how their relationsip satisfaction changes.

Q6. c, Regression assumptions that have been met.

Q7. b, The power of the test (is not a random variable, it's calculated).

Q8. c, Insignificant results are commonly relegated to the file drawer.
If this were actually true, only 5% or less of the published research would not be reproducible. So relegating insignificant research to the file drawer does not help to explain why more than 5% of the published results appear to be type-1 errors.

Notes on Q8: 
* a, certainly explains that some studies could have obtained significant p-values randomly. These random results would not be reproducible.
* b, some researchers could have exploited degrees of freedom to obtain more significant results e.g. stopping data collection at a convenient time, or using only parts of the data or variables, or using a sub-par test of significance for the given situation.
* d, as you test more hypothesis, the probability of finding a significant result due to chance also increases


# Part 2. Test Selection
Q9. a, chi-square (use_reddit ~ marital_status), categorilcal, nominal.

Notes on Q9: 
* use_reddit is a categorical variable with two categories (Considering "Refused"" and "No"" as missing values).
* marital_status is a categorical variable with 7 categories. These are not ordinal, nor interval. Just names of categories that cannot be ordered.
Given the above info about the variables:
* t-test cannot be used because it requires numeric data
* Pearson Correlation cannot be used because it requires two variables from a Gaussian distribution
* Wilcoxon signed rank test requires same participants in different measures and it is limited to two groups.

Q10. d, ANOVA (life_quality ~ region).

Notes on Q10: 
* region is a categorical variable with 4 categories.
* life_quality is an ordinal variable with 5 levels (Excellent to Poor). We cannot assume that it is interval with the information given.
* we can assume that different people are in different categories on both region and life_quality
Given the info above:
* Pearson correlation cannot be used because it requires two variables from a Gaussian distribution
* Wilcoxon signed rank test requires same participants in different measures; limited to two groups
* Binary logistic regression requires exactly two categories in outcome variable
That leaves us with the controversial choice of ANOVA on ordinal outcome. Robust ANOVA/Kruskal Wallis test would be better but that is not one of the options.

Q11. b, t-test (years_in_relationship ~ flirted_online).

Notes on Q11: 
* flirted_online is a categorical variable with two categories
* years_in_relationship is a ratio variable: there's a true zero and 2-1 = 3-2.

Given the info above:
* Fisher's exact test requires categorical variables.
* Wilcoxon signed rank test requires same participants in different measures; limited to two groups
* ANOVA is used when there are more than two categories and the dependent variable is normally distributed.
In fact, we should use an independent bootstrapped t-test or Mann Whitney Test (aka Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) in this case because we do not have homogeneity of variance between the two flirted_online groups (leveneTest).

Q12. a, chi-square (lgbt ~ adults_in_household).

Notes on Q12:
* lgbt is a categorical variable with six categories
* adults_in_household is recorded as an ordinal variable because 6 or more is considered one category.
* ANOVA cannot be used because it requires a normally distributed dependent variable
* Pearson correlation cannot be used because it requires two variables from a Gaussian distribution
* Wilcoxon rank sum test requires exactly two groups

Q13. a, Pearson Correlation (totalchildren ~ age).

Q14. b, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (number of children ~ gender of people aged 31).

# Part 3. Data Analysis
Let's load the data first.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# getwd()
# setwd("W203 Week 15")
dat <- read.csv("Dating.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## 15. OLS Regression

### a. Mean of life_quality
Before we calculate the mean of `life_quality` we need to omit the missing values. Codebook shows that `life_quality` is measured on a Likert scale, and therefore "Don't know" and "Refused" can be considered missing values.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
unique(dat$life_quality)

# omit "Refused" and "Don't know" and calculate mean
lq <- dat$life_quality[!dat$life_quality %in% c("Refused", "Don't know")]
lq <- lq[!is.na(lq)] # omit NA
lq <- as.numeric(as.character(lq))

# reverse the scale
lq <- abs(lq - 6)

# calculate the mean
mean(lq) # 3.392921

```

### b. Mean of years_in_relationship
We have to calculate the mean of `years_in_relationship`. We have to make sure that string values are converted to the correct number. And we have to leave the "0" in there as a valid value.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# omit "Refused", "Don't know" and " "
# leave "0" in there
yr <- dat$years_in_relationship[!dat$years_in_relationship %in% c("Refused", 
                                                                  "Don't know", 
                                                                  " ")]
yr <- yr[!is.na(yr)]
yr <- as.numeric(as.character(yr))

# calculate the mean
mean(yr) # 13.47697
```

### c. Create a subset of data omitting missing values
We need three variables `life_quality`, `years_in_relationship` and `use_internet` in our analysis, so let's create a subset of our data. We need to remove missing values. Code book shows that `use_internet` has two valid categories "Yes" and "No" so we will keep only those two.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ds1 <- dat[, c("life_quality", "years_in_relationship", "use_internet")]

# check what's in use_internet
unique(ds1$use_internet)

# keep only complete cases
ds1 <- apply(ds1, 2, 
             function(x) {ifelse(x %in% c("Refused", "Don't know", " "), 
                                 NA, x)})
ds1 <- ds1[complete.cases(ds1), ]

# number of cases left
nrow(ds1) #1090 cases left

ds1 <- data.frame(ds1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # convert to data.frame
# re-apply value conversion to `life_quality`
ds1[, "life_quality"] <- abs(as.numeric(ds1[, "life_quality"]) - 6) 
ds1[, "years_in_relationship"] <- 
  as.numeric(as.character(ds1[, "years_in_relationship"]))

```

### d. Fit an OLS model: life_quality ~ years_in_relationship
Let's run an OLS model that predicts `life_quality` as a function of `years_in_relationship`.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lm1 <- lm(life_quality ~ years_in_relationship, data = ds1)

lm1s <- summary(lm1)
lm1s

# slope co-efficient (years_in_relationship)
lm1s$coefficients[2] # slope is 0.00499
# This represents a ~0.005 positive change in life satisfication for each 
# 1 year increase in years_in_relationship

# slope t-value
lm1s$coefficients[6] #t-value =2.533
# We have a t-value = 2.533, p < 0.05 
# which means that slope is statistically significant

# R-squared
lm1s$r.squared 
# R-squared = 0.00586, i.e. 0.58% of variance 
# in life_quality explained by years_in_relationship

# Pearson's R
sqrt(lm1s$r.squared) 
# Pearson's R = 0.07656 (< 0.30) which points to no linear correlation

# Confidence interval of slope
confint(lm1) # confidence interval of slope does not cross 0

# For evaluating the overall model
# F-ratio obtained before is greater than the critical F value
cbind("f ratio" = lm1s$fstatistic[1], 
      "critical f value" = qf(c(0.975), 1, 1088)) # F-ratio = 6.41427 

# p-value of F-ratio is < 0.05
pf(lm1s$fstatistic[1], lm1s$fstatistic[2], 
   lm1s$fstatistic[3], lower.tail = FALSE) * 2 # p < 0.05
```
Given the above information, we have a statistically significant result. Our t-value also shows that the slope coefficient is 2.533 times larger than its standard error, and we see that its confidence interval does not cross zero. Yet we have an R-squared of 0.00586 (0.58% of variance explained) and R is < 0.30. This shows that the result is NOT practically significant.

### e. Fit a second OLS model
Let's add `use_internet` to the OLS mode.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lm2 <- lm(life_quality ~ years_in_relationship + use_internet, data = ds1)
lm2s <- summary(lm2)
lm2s

# slope coefficient for use_internet
lm2s$coefficients[3] # slope is 0.40374 

# slope t-value (use_internet)
lm2s$coefficients[9] #t-value = 4.571
# We have a t-value = 4.571, p < 0.05 
# which means that slope is statistically significant

# R-squared
lm2s$adj.r.squared # Adjusted R-squared = 0.02282 
# i.e. 2.28% of variance in life_quality is explained by 
# years_in_relationship & use_internet together

# Pearson's R
sqrt(lm2s$adj.r.squared) 
# Pearson's R = 0.15105 (< 0.30) which points to no linear relationship

# Confidence interval of slope
confint(lm2) # confidence interval of slope does not cross 0

# For evaluating the overall model
cbind("f ratio" = lm2s$fstatistic[1], 
      "critical f value" = qf(c(0.975), 1, 1088)) # F-ratio = 13.71293 
# F-ratio obtained before is greater than the critical F value

# p-value of F-ratio is less than 0.05
pf(lm2s$fstatistic[1], lm2s$fstatistic[2], lm2s$fstatistic[3], 
   lower.tail = FALSE) * 2 # p < 0.01

```
We see from the above information that `use_internet` has a statistically significant slope. Yet the adjusted r-squared value explains only 2.28% of the total variation in `life_quality`. This result is not practically significant.

### f. F-ratio and p-value between two OLS models
Let's compare our two OLS models. We will use ANOVA to compare the two.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lmcompare <- anova(lm1, lm2)
lmcompare # F-ratio = 20.894, p < 0.01
```
Using `years_in_relationship` and `use_internet` together improved the fit of the model to the data compared to `years_in_relationship` alone. F(1, 1087) = 20.894, p < 0.01.
This shows that the second model using both `years_in_relationship` and `use_internet` is significantly better than the first model.


## Q16. Logistic Regression

### a. Odds that a responded has flirted online
We will use logistic regression to test the odds of `flirted_online`. Code book shows that "Refused" and "Don't know" can be omitted as missing. There are two valid categories i.e. "Yes" and "No".
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ds2 <- dat[, c("usr", "flirted_online")]
nrow(ds2)

unique(ds2$flirted_online)
unique(ds2$usr)

# omit missing values
ds2 <- apply(ds2, 2, function(x) {ifelse(x %in% c("Refused", "Don't know", " "), NA, x)})
ds2 <- ds2[complete.cases(ds2), ]
nrow(ds2) #1885 cases left
ds2 <- data.frame(ds2, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # convert to data.frame

require(gmodels)
# Let's compute a simple odds ratio
ct <- CrossTable(ds2$flirted_online)
ct$prop.row[2] / ct$prop.row[1] 
# odds ratio in sample (flirted / not flirted) = 0.26087
```
The odds that someone has flirted online vs. not flirt online are 0.26087 (or approximately 1:4).

### b. Logistic regression: flirted_online ~ usr
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# convert flirted_online to factor
# Let's use the base category where flirted_online equals "No"
ds2$flirted_online <- factor(ds2$flirted_online)
ds2$flirted_online <- relevel(ds2$flirted_online, ref = "No")

ds2$usr <- factor(ds2$usr) # rural is the base factor

gm <- glm(flirted_online ~ usr, data = ds2, family = binomial)
gm
gms <- summary(gm)
gms

# Akaike Information Criterion
gms$aic # AIC = 1909.359
```
Our model has an AIC of 1909.359.

### c. Odds of urban user flirting online vs. rural user
The `usr` variable has three categories "Urban", "Suburban" and "Rural". So we will compare "Urban" vs. both the other categories as those two are not "Urban".
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# get odds ratio from the model
exp(gm$coefficients) 
# Urban user is 2.10 times more likely than rural user to flirt online in sample


# we can use the model to predict the probability of flirting online 
# and get odds ratio for that too
# use type = "response"" to get probabilities instead of log-odds

# flirt probability of rural user
pflirt.rural <- predict.glm(gm, newdata = data.frame("usr" = "Rural"), 
                            type = "response") 
pflirt.rural

# flirt probability of urban user
pflirt.urban <- predict.glm(gm, newdata = data.frame("usr" = "Urban"), 
                            type = "response")
pflirt.urban

# flirt odds urban : rural
pflirt.odds <- pflirt.urban / pflirt.rural
pflirt.odds 
# Urban user is 1.83 times more likely to flirt than rural user

# confidence interval of odds
exp(confint(gm))

```
Odds that an Urban user has flirted online are 1.83 to 1 compared to Rural user. These odds are significantly different because without considering location the odds of flirting online are only 0.26 to 1. That is, an urban user is 7 times more likely to flirt online than a generic user in this data set. We see from summary of our model that for Urban users z-value = 4.127, p < 0.05. We also see that the confidence intervals do not cross zero. We can say that this result is practically significant.
